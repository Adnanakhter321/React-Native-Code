        <p>Have you ever done any extreme sports? Are you an adrenaline junkie? Read this story about one man facing his

        <p class="p2">So we’re driving along, a road in the middle of nowhere, a few trees now and then on each side of
            the road, mountains in the distance, there hasn’t been a town for ages and then you see this sign, not
            really a proper sign at all, just a piece of card with some words scribbled on it: ‘Bungee Jumping, 5km’,
            and an arrow pointing to the left. I can’t even see a road going left, and there’s certainly no sign of any
            bungee jumping, but you insist, the idea has taken you, you’re crazy about it, you’ve always wanted to do
            bungee jumping. I know, you think I’m boring because I don’t want to go.</p>
