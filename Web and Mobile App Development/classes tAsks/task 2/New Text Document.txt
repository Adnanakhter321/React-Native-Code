Task:
1. Make 3 arrays of 4 different colours. There will be 12 colours in total. 
2. Make 4 divs with some para.
3. Width of each div will be 100% of body and hight will be 400px.
4. Para should remain in centre horizontally and vertically both. (Use flex-box)
5. Use 1 array colours combinations as background color of each div. Each div will be in different background colour. Set background colour from JS.
6. Make carousel of all 4 divs. Mean only 1 div will be shown on screen at a time. Two arrows will be placed on extreme left and extreme right centre using flex-box. 
7. Clicking on left or right arrows will change  divs to next or previous one.
8. If no click occurs, it will stil slide to next div after 3 seconds. 
9. After 4th slide, next slide will be the first one and from first slide previous will be the 4th slide.
10. If someone clicks on paragraph instead of arrows, it will change background colour to other arrays of colour. In this way each paragraph can have 3 different colours from 3 different arrays you made in 1 step.
