      <h3>  19 Easy Short Stories with Big Ideas for Thoughtful English Learners
        Have you tried to run a marathon with no practice?<h3>
        
           <h2>Why Short Stories Are Best for English Learning</h4> 
           <strong> You get more time to focus on individual words.</strong> When a text is short, you can devote <br>
           more time to learning how every single word is used and what importance it has in the piece. <br>
            You can read a whole story in one sitting.  Attention spans are very important for learning, <br> and the ability to finish a story gives you more time to digest it. Short stories are designed <br> to give you maximum information with minimal effort. <br> <br>
            <strong>It is best for consistency</strong>. It is far easier to read one story every day than trying to read a big <br> novel that never seems to end. <br> <br>
            <strong>You can share them easily in a group.</strong> Since short stories can be read in a single setting,<br> they are ideal for book clubs and learning circles. Most of the time these groups do not work <br> because members have no time to read. Short stories are the perfect solution. <br> <br>
           <strong> You can focus more on ideas and concepts.</strong> Language is less about words and more about the <br> meaning behind them. If you spend all your time learning vocabulary and grammar, you will never <br> be able to fluently speak a language because you will have little to talk about. These short stories give <br> you the opportunity to understand big ideas in context. <br> <br> <hr>
